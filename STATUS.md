# Status — 2026-10-07

What is true now. The dated experiment log that led here, including every
superseded conclusion and dead end, is in
[`docs/status-history.md`](docs/status-history.md); per-area evidence is in
`docs/protocol/`. Labels: **live** = seen working against the real server,
**acked** = the server accepted it but a handset result is not confirmed,
**offline** = tested locally only.

Receive recovery (2026-10-07): the saved account recovered its blocked direct
and group texts, then delivery-confirmed both on live redelivery. The two
recovered-message read receipts received matching server ACKs. Current receipt
state: eight acknowledged reads and one acknowledged retry. Handset blue ticks
and fresh-message automatic-read validation remain unconfirmed.

The causes in our implementation were blanket refusal of changed peer pins
and group pairwise selection of a PN ratchet despite a held LID session. An
explicit APK-compatible incoming policy now commits an authenticated peer
replacement atomically with encrypted prior-key/session history and an
`IdentityChanged` event. The library default remains `pinned`; profile `l`
selects `apk_authenticated` in its preserved private corrected configuration.
No local account identity, send ID or reservation was reset. Automatic reads
also cover eligible authenticated duplicates, with once-only write-cut coverage.
Human safety-number verification remains unfinished. Outgoing key-bundle
mismatches now suspend the original queued intent before ratchet use;
`outbox-suspended` inspects them offline. Independent
`transport.outgoing_identity_changes=apk_authenticated` now stages a signed
directory-bundle replacement and commits prior-state history, the identity
event and original send reservation atomically. Explicitly selected suspended
intents can use their saved reply without another key query; invalid signatures,
own-account changes, stale-pin rollback and uncertain sends remain blocked.
The canonical outgoing policy remains pinned; live replacement is unverified. `peer-identity` now inspects both namespaces offline;
the recovered direct peer has different PN/LID pins, each matching its own
held session. Authenticated history connects the PN pin to the updated LID pin.
A 25-second directory-only live check obtained a valid signed current bundle
matching the recovered LID pin and differing from the PN pin. Peer pin/session
summaries stayed unchanged. One private test draft awaits authorization; no
new chat was sent.

Private state was recovered from the former checkout in the desktop Trash,
with originals preserved. The selected profile has no eligible chat sends or
queued actions. The successful 45-second receive window and 20-second read
window sent no queued chats. Evidence: [peer identity](docs/protocol/peer-identity.md),
[group session selection](docs/protocol/groups.md#group-pairwise-pnlid-session-correction-2026-10-07),
[read recovery](docs/protocol/messaging-transport.md#authenticated-duplicate-auto-read-correction-2026-10-07).
The earlier interval with no incoming messages is still unexplained.

## Accounts

Registration uses the recipe in
[registration-lab](docs/protocol/registration-lab.md#working-recipe)
(`enc_empty_h`, 2.26.37.70 User-Agent and token material).
`lab-signup resend-code` asks for a new code on an existing pending attempt.

## Messaging

| Capability | State | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct text, PN or LID addressed | live | [messaging-transport](docs/protocol/messaging-transport.md) |
| Direct image, voice note, view-once image | live (receipt confirmed; playback not) | same |
| Replies, reactions, polls (direct) | live | same, [chat-actions](docs/protocol/chat-actions.md) |
| Receive + decrypt direct and group messages | live | [groups](docs/protocol/groups.md) |
| Read receipts, group (`mark-read --chat …@g.us`) | acked 2026-09-25; handset "Read by" unconfirmed | [messaging-transport](docs/protocol/messaging-transport.md) |
| Automatic read receipts (`transport.mark_read`, `listen`) | offline | same |
| Group send (sender-key fan-out) | live — operator read it | [groups](docs/protocol/groups.md) |
| Group replies | live — shown on the handset (the operator reacted to one) | same |
| Group reactions | **not rendering**: payload, stanza and target match the official client's, but the handset shows nothing and the server's ack carries no `count`; cause unknown | same |
| Retry receipts: sending ours when we cannot decrypt | runtime retry server-acknowledged 2026-10-06; redelivery still undecryptable | [messaging-transport](docs/protocol/messaging-transport.md) |
| Retry receipts: answering theirs after a fan-out | offline; one live retry was received before the answer existed | [groups](docs/protocol/groups.md) |
| Status: receive | live | [status](docs/protocol/status.md) |
| Status: post styled text | live — operator saw it | same |
| Status: post image | acked as `type=text`; now `type=media`, **not yet sent live** | same |
| Status: viewers (delivered/read/played) and likes received | live (`status-viewers`) | same |
| Status: sending a like, HD dual upload, audio | not implemented | same |
| App-state writes (contact action) incl. 409 catch-up | live | [chat-actions](docs/protocol/chat-actions.md) |
| Block/unblock, contact check, disappearing, keep-in-chat | live | same |

| Display name (`presence name=…`) | written live, handset unconfirmed | [presence](docs/protocol/presence.md) |
| Display name app-state record (`pushNameSetting`, `critical_block`) | live — accepted at version 1 | same |
| About text (`iq xmlns=status`, `whatsapp-cli about`) | server-accepted 2026-09-28, as reported in the session export; handset unconfirmed | [presence](docs/protocol/presence.md) |
| Typing / recording indicators (`chatstate`) | typing handset-confirmed in the session export; recording and incoming indicators unconfirmed | same |

| Prekey upload and replenishment | live | [messaging-completion](docs/messaging-completion.md) |

A single undecryptable incoming message no longer ends a session; it degrades
to `Undecryptable` and we send a retry receipt. Direct messages from a LID sender now decrypt with the LID
session our group sends established; that was why one of the operator's
messages stayed unreadable for four days (fixed 2026-09-28, verified by offline
replay). A group payload addressed only to this device (such as a
`messageHistoryBundle`) is now recorded and acknowledged instead of being
redelivered at every login.

## Not done

- **Stickers and video notes.** Field numbers are decoded from the APK
  (`stickerMessage` 26, `ptvMessage` 66, `VideoMessage` inner fields);
  `StickerMessage`'s inner layout is not yet decoded. No incoming sticker/PTV
  stanza has been captured. [apk-analysis](docs/protocol/apk-analysis.md).
- Calls; profile picture.
- Privacy settings IQ (namespace unknown).
- Channels and QR/companion pairing — parked by the owner.
- Companion-device fan-out and own-account device sync.
- An unexplained 49-byte `[102]` payload seen on receive.

## Offline verification

509 all-feature tests (`cargo test --locked --workspace --all-features`) and
212 default-feature tests (`cargo test --locked --workspace`) pass on
2026-10-07; Clippy with `-D warnings` is clean. Rust 1.98.1 locally and in CI. Store, codec, crash
matrix, registration state machine and transport coverage are described in
[docs/design](docs/design/README.md) and the per-area protocol docs.

Before any live check, rebuild the release binary: `cargo test` does not
refresh `target/release/whatsapp-cli`, and a stale one once produced a wrong
"cause eliminated" conclusion.
