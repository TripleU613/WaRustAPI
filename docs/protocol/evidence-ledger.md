# Evidence ledger

Labels (docs/design/README.md 6.1): `Observed` · `Derived` · `ReferenceOnly` · `Unknown`.
Every important wire constant used by the code points here through a
`ledger_ref` string. **No `Observed` transport fact exists yet**: nothing has
been captured from the pinned Android client or a live server.

Reference client: `com.whatsapp` 2.26.36.75 (code 263607533), APK sha256
`ce746890…922e9`, signing cert sha256 `39:87:D0:43:…:5D:44`. Full record:
`crates/whatsapp-api/fixtures/reference-manifest.json`.

Reference implementations (web multi-device profile, **not** Android primary):
`tulir/whatsmeow` @ 2375e175 (MPL-2.0); `oxidezap/whatsapp-rust` @ 4a0721b (MIT
headline; see ADR 0005 for AGPL files).

## Dated client observations (static)

2026-09-17 — APK `com.whatsapp` 2.26.36.75, string tables of `classes*.dex`
extracted with `cargo run -p xtask -- apk-strings <apk>` (449,216 unique
strings). Findings are in `crates/whatsapp-api/fixtures/reference-manifest.json`
under `client_observations`. Presence proves the client contains a constant,
not how it is used; nothing here changes a wire fact from hypothesis to fact
without a capture. Native `libs.so` carries no protocol strings.

2026-09-17 — a separately hashed, WhatsApp-signed newer build
(`com.whatsapp` 2.26.37.70, code 263707033, sha256 `b2090b…ee732`) was used as
a comparison because the official `/current/` URL had advanced and the pinned
APK was unavailable. Structural bytecode analysis observed `WA 06 03`, the
`https://v.whatsapp.net` base plus 17 `/v2/*` paths, UTF-8 URL-encoded form
POST bodies, construction of the `authkey`/`e_*` key bundle, the same
`WhatsAppLongTerm1` root and issuer serial used by the reference code, and
chat connection candidates on ports 443/5222 (with a port-80 fallback). Its
token dictionary differs from the pinned fixture. Its registration bridge
also parses the JSON response status/reason and cooldown vocabulary recorded
in the comparison fixture. The key bundle uses the client Noise public key,
key type `05`, big-endian 4-byte/3-byte identifiers, and unpadded URL-safe
Base64. The `/v2/code` token is derived locally with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 over the
package/logo material and HMAC-SHA1 over the signing certificate, primary-DEX
MD5, and national number. Fresh fallback prerequisites are persisted UUIDv4
values for `fdid`/`expid`/`access_session_id` and 20 random bytes apiece for
the recovery and backup tokens; the exact recipes are in the comparison fixture.
The built-in socket path does not construct a WebSocket: it supplies a Java
`SSLSocketFactory` for numbered-edge port 443, but uses raw TCP for primary or
fallback gateways even on port 443 and for all built-in port-5222 branches.
Dedicated port-80 states wrap those raw sockets in a pseudo-HTTP/1.1 chunked
stream: `POST /chat`, host `c.whatsapp.net`, an 8,192-byte output chunk buffer,
and 1,024-byte response/chunk-line bounds.
These are version-scoped comparative observations only: the
pinned-profile labels above remain unchanged. Full details and hashes are in
`fixtures/comparisons/whatsapp-2.26.37.70.json` and `decompilation-log.md`.

Additional comparison framing observation (2026-09-17): `LX/1NX;->write(VLII)`
rejects lengths at or above `0x1000000`; `LX/1Lz;->A04(LI)` encodes the
accepted length as three big-endian bytes. This establishes a static writer
bound of 16,777,215 body bytes for 2.26.37.70 only, not an observed server
Noise record limit. See the continuation entry in `decompilation-log.md`.

## Dated server observations

The active pinned reference manifest still has `server_observation: null`.

2026-09-18 UTC, comparison lab only: one operator-authorized diagnostic
`POST https://v.whatsapp.net/v2/code` reused an existing legacy attempt's
configuration and keys. The server returned HTTP 200 and parsed JSON
`status=fail`, `reason=bad_param`; the bounded response body was 58 bytes.
Parsed retry/SMS/voice waits were absent. No successful code delivery,
registration, or specific offending parameter was established. The new
HTTP status and recognized reason were verified in the encrypted saved state.
No further request followed, and the durable one-shot diagnostic latch remains.
Phone, tokens, keys and raw request/response bodies are intentionally not published.

2026-09-18 UTC, follow-up comparison: an explicitly authorized diagnostic
repeat on the separately supplied comparison number reused its saved keys and
unchanged 612-byte form. HTTP 200 / `fail` / `bad_param` was unchanged; the
response was again 58 bytes. The updated parser retained no recognized `param`
hint (`invalid_parameter: null`). This does not prove that no unknown hint was
present. No new optional fields were populated and no successful signup or OTP
delivery was established. The dedicated bad-parameter diagnostic latch is used;
no automatic retry or identity rotation occurred.
