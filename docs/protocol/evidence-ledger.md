# Evidence ledger

### Polls — 2026-09-20

`LX/BYa`, `LX/BWH`, `LX/BOq`, `LX/BQ2`, `LX/BSo` descriptors give the poll
protobufs; a live poll used top-level fields 35 and 64 with `meta
polltype=creation`. `LX/0ZG.A01` shows the vote AAD (`pollId || 0 || voterJid`)
and the inputs handed to native code for key derivation; the derivation itself
is not in DEX. Our vote and our poll were server-accepted; the poll was
delivered. Vote display is pending handset confirmation.

### Reactions — 2026-09-19

`LX/BWI`/`LX/BZa` descriptors give ReactionMessage (key=1, text=2,
groupingKey=3, senderTimestampMs=4) and MessageKey (remoteJid=1, fromMe=2,
id=3, participant=4); `LX/0zO.A01` lists the `reaction` stanza kind. A live
incoming reaction (`message type=reaction`, payload field 46) decrypted and
projected as a message update; a reaction sent back was server-accepted.

### Live confirmation of 2.26.37.71-derived requests — 2026-09-19

On the saved comparison account: the `iq/encrypt/set` prekey upload built from
2.26.37.71 evidence was accepted (`iq type=result`, 50 keys, no `count_low`); the
`usync devices version=2` query was answered with a `device-list` of one primary
device and no `key-index-list`, consistent with a single-device contact; an
explicit `receipt type=read` received a matching `ack class=receipt type=read`.
These are server-reported outcomes, not handset observations.

### Comparison 2.26.37.71 contact device-list sync — 2026-09-18

Same build. `LX/0u7.A06` builds the `usync` query (`sid`, `index`, `last`,
`mode`, `context`, `query/devices version=2`, `list/user`), `LX/0u7.C8f` parses
`device-list/device[id,key-index,is_hosted]` and `key-index-list[ts,
expected_ts]`, `LX/11T.A07` verifies the signed list with the pinned primary
identity (or an ADV-provided key, not implemented), `LX/11Q.A09` parses
`notification type=devices` and `LX/101.A02` records the user for a sync.
Implemented for contacts with tests; own-account sync and send fan-out remain
open. No live query has run.

### Comparison 2.26.37.71 prekey replenishment — 2026-09-18

A second comparison build, 2.26.37.71 (APK SHA-256 `1755111a…7d5c`, same
signing certificate as 2.26.37.70, different obfuscated class names), provides
the one-time prekey path: generation of `min(812 - unsent, 50)` keys with ids
`((next + i) % 0xFFFFFE) + 1` (`LX/0ko.A06`), the 812-key unsent batch
(`LX/0kf.A01`), the `iq/encrypt/set` upload layout with 3-byte key ids and a
4-byte registration id (`LX/0y0.A00` case 85, `LX/1Lz.A03/A04`), the
`notification type=encrypt count/@value` trigger and its acknowledgement
(`LX/14z.A09/A02`), startup upload of unsent keys (`LX/DNq.run`) and the
`count_low` follow-up in the result (`LX/Bor.A03`). Kyber (`pq_*`) children are
optional in the APK and are not sent. Offline tests reproduce the layout; no
live upload has run. Details: docs/protocol/messaging-transport.md.

### Comparison receive activation and view-once prefetch — 2026-09-18

Derived from 2.26.37.70: `LX/Avw.A00` 0x0008–0068 builds
`iq/id/xmlns=passive/type=set/to=server` with `active` for true;
primary ConnectionThread `LX/0iS.A0e` 0x0014–004a generates the ID and
calls that true branch. `LX/Cns.A00` 0x007c–0108 constructs delivery
receipts with optional type/participant/recipient; `A05` 0x0000–0074
constructs receipt acknowledgements, omitting type for delivery. Our bounded
implementation supports primary direct routes only; read/opened receipts are
emitted only on explicit request (viewer completion or `send_receipt`), never
automatically. Messages must already be authenticated and committed before delivery
confirmation; all incoming frames are encrypted at rest before acknowledgement.

Observed on our comparison lab client: activation result accepted. Activation
alone yielded the five old messages. Adding delivery/receipt confirmations was
followed by four additional authenticated payloads; one had direct ImageMessage
flag 25. A single HTTPS prefetch downloaded 91,562 ciphertext bytes and passed
size/hash/MAC verification. Encrypted state is `downloaded_unopened`, with no
plaintext export or opened receipt. Queue progress followed the confirmations;
the exact internal server queue policy remains unknown. This is not a capture
from an official Android device or evidence for the pinned build.

### Comparison image upload/send — 2026-09-18

Comparison 2.26.37.70: media route query returned nine hosts and auth. The first
route expired before use and was explicitly refreshed; no upload used expired
auth. One encrypted PNG POST returned HTTP 200 with URL/direct_path, followed
by authenticated login and a matching encrypted-image message acknowledgement.
Reusing the private request returned locally without uploading or sending again.
The operator subsequently confirmed receiving the image. APK mappings, limits and commands are in
[messaging transport](messaging-transport.md#image-sending-comparison-lab).
No route credentials, media keys, phone numbers or returned private URLs are
included here. This observation is comparison-only, not the pinned APK profile.

### Comparison inbound messages — 2026-09-18

One bounded authenticated connection captured two `enc/v=2/type=msg` messages.
Both used a primary LID `from` and explicit `sender_pn`; comparison APK
`LX/CmF.A01` 0x0096–00c6 reads `sender_pn` as `PhoneUserJid`. Selecting the saved
pinned PN session allowed authenticated offline Signal decryption of both.
Plaintext/session were committed atomically and a repeated offline run skipped
both. This verifies this mapped established-session case, not general LID or
prekey receiving. No message content, sender values or credentials are recorded.

Subsequent offline protobuf inspection established one extended-text payload
(Message fields 6/35) and one protocol payload (field 12, type 4), not two user
replies. Comparison `LX/BXF.dynamicMethod` 0x0578 and `LX/BXE.dynamicMethod`
0x01c4 supply the field schemas; `LX/C1B.<clinit>` 0x0028–003c labels type 4
`EPHEMERAL_SYNC_RESPONSE`. No new connection or Signal ratchet mutation was needed.

Labels (docs/design/README.md 6.1): `Observed` · `Derived` · `ReferenceOnly` · `Unknown`.

## Dated client observations (static)

2026-09-17 — APK `com.whatsapp` 2.26.36.75, string tables of `classes*.dex`
extracted with `cargo run -p xtask -- apk-strings <apk>` (449,216 unique
strings). Findings are in `crates/whatsapp-api/fixtures/reference-manifest.json`
under `client_observations`. Presence proves the client contains a constant,
not how it is used; nothing here changes a wire fact from hypothesis to fact
without a capture. Native `libs.so` carries no protocol strings.

2026-09-17 — a separately hashed, WhatsApp-signed newer build
(`com.whatsapp` 2.26.37.70, code 263707033, sha256 `b2090b…ee732`) was used as
a comparison because the official `/current/` URL had advanced and the pinned
APK was unavailable. Structural bytecode analysis observed `WA 06 03`, the
`https://v.whatsapp.net` base plus 17 `/v2/*` paths, UTF-8 URL-encoded form
POST bodies, construction of the `authkey`/`e_*` key bundle, the same
`WhatsAppLongTerm1` root and issuer serial used by the reference code, and
chat connection candidates on ports 443/5222 (with a port-80 fallback). Its
token dictionary differs from the pinned fixture. Its registration bridge
also parses the JSON response status/reason and cooldown vocabulary recorded
in the comparison fixture. The key bundle uses the client Noise public key,
key type `05`, big-endian 4-byte/3-byte identifiers, and unpadded URL-safe
Base64. The `/v2/code` token is derived locally with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 over the
package/logo material and HMAC-SHA1 over the signing certificate, primary-DEX
MD5, and national number. Fresh fallback prerequisites are persisted UUIDv4
values for `fdid`/`expid`/`access_session_id` and 20 random bytes apiece for
the recovery and backup tokens; the exact recipes are in the comparison fixture.
The built-in socket path does not construct a WebSocket: it supplies a Java
`SSLSocketFactory` for numbered-edge port 443, but uses raw TCP for primary or
fallback gateways even on port 443 and for all built-in port-5222 branches.
Dedicated port-80 states wrap those raw sockets in a pseudo-HTTP/1.1 chunked
stream: `POST /chat`, host `c.whatsapp.net`, an 8,192-byte output chunk buffer,
and 1,024-byte response/chunk-line bounds.
These are version-scoped comparative observations only: the
pinned-profile labels above remain unchanged. Full details and hashes are in
`fixtures/comparisons/whatsapp-2.26.37.70.json` and `decompilation-log.md`.

Additional comparison framing observation (2026-09-17): `LX/1NX;->write(VLII)`
rejects lengths at or above `0x1000000`; `LX/1Lz;->A04(LI)` encodes the
accepted length as three big-endian bytes. This establishes a static writer
bound of 16,777,215 body bytes for 2.26.37.70 only, not an observed server
Noise record limit. See the continuation entry in `decompilation-log.md`.

## Dated server observations

The active pinned reference manifest still has `server_observation: null`.

2026-09-18 UTC, comparison messaging lab: the standard snow XX message adapter
received a server hello but failed decryption. APK sequencing showed an extra
empty-payload transcript hash in the adapter, absent from `LX/1NZ.A06`. After
correcting that sequencing over existing cryptographic primitives, the client
verified the WhatsApp root/intermediate/leaf chain and its binding to the Noise
remote static (intermediate serial 3, leaf serial 361). A 34-byte minimal primary
login using saved registration credentials returned encrypted `success`.

One recipient-key query returned identity, signed and one-time keys. The client
verified the signed key, established Signal encryption, atomically committed
session/send intent and transmitted one direct text. An encrypted matching
`ack`, `class=message`, without `error` established server acceptance. A local
repeat of the same request read the persisted acknowledgement and sent nothing.
Handset delivery/read is unconfirmed. No phone, plaintext, key or private stanza
is recorded here. These observations apply to the comparison lab only, not the
pinned default profile. [Implementation and static sources](messaging-transport.md).

2026-09-18 UTC, comparison lab only: one operator-authorized diagnostic
`POST https://v.whatsapp.net/v2/code` reused an existing legacy attempt's
configuration and keys. The server returned HTTP 200 and parsed JSON
`status=fail`, `reason=bad_param`; the bounded response body was 58 bytes.
Parsed retry/SMS/voice waits were absent. No successful code delivery,
registration, or specific offending parameter was established. The new
HTTP status and recognized reason were verified in the encrypted saved state.
No further request followed, and the durable one-shot diagnostic latch remains.
Phone, tokens, keys and raw request/response bodies are intentionally not published.

2026-09-18 UTC, follow-up comparison: an explicitly authorized diagnostic
repeat on the separately supplied comparison number reused its saved keys and
unchanged 612-byte form. HTTP 200 / `fail` / `bad_param` was unchanged; the
response was again 58 bytes. The updated parser retained no recognized `param`
hint (`invalid_parameter: null`). This does not prove that no unknown hint was
present. No new optional fields were populated and no successful signup or OTP
delivery was established. The dedicated bad-parameter diagnostic latch is used;
no automatic retry or identity rotation occurred.

2026-09-18 UTC, APK-only controlled continuation: empty-H, seven fallback
fields, and post-failure reason/metrics experiments each still returned
HTTP 200 / fail / bad_param. The next experiment used the APK's
unknown-build-properties User-Agent and advanced the checked preparation count
to 7. The 1167-byte ENC/H request returned HTTP 200 / fail / format_wrong
(64-byte response, 189 ms). The new refusal is persisted on the same attempt
and account keys. This is changed behavior, not successful registration.
No recognized offending-field hint or wait was supplied. Detailed inputs and
static offsets are recorded in [the HTTP analysis](http-post-analysis.md).

Subsequent APK-only analysis resolved `format_wrong` through response enum 29,
`VerifyPhoneNumber.A19`, and dialog 53 to resource `0x7f123741`: the official
client says the mobile number is invalid for the country. This identifies the
client's interpretation, not the server's internal rule. No additional live
attempt, identity change, or successful signup occurred during this analysis.

Next operator-requested test used a different supplied number and its own
private JSON/store, leaving the previous attempt untouched. The JSON selected
`enc_empty_h`, the APK unknown-build-properties User-Agent, the seven documented
fallback fields, and `client_metrics` preparation count 1; no prior-failure
reason was copied. A phone-bound token was derived from the same comparison
APK. One 1126-byte POST returned HTTP 200 / fail / bad_token (61 bytes, 559 ms),
with no recognized parameter hint or wait. This is a different refusal, not
accepted registration, proven protocol progress, or confirmed OTP delivery.
No retry followed. Because number, fresh identity, and request context differ,
this is not a controlled single-variable comparison with the previous attempt.

Token audit subsequently found a single-byte transcription error in the
PBKDF2 salt: offset 62 was `0xfc`, not the APK's `0xf8`. After correcting it,
the private profile changed only its token. One explicitly authorized retry
preserved the same attempt/account material and all other inner fields
(including the previous metrics value for this token-only comparison).
The fresh encrypted envelope was 1123 bytes. The server returned HTTP 200 /
sent (347 bytes, 3219 ms), retry/SMS wait 125 seconds and voice wait 65 seconds.
The saved state is now an SMS challenge. This is server-reported dispatch;
receipt, OTP verification, completed registration and messaging are not yet
confirmed. No further request or OTP submission followed.

The operator then selected the original historical number again. Its saved
opaque refusal was migrated once through corrected JSON: fixed phone-bound
token, APK unknown-build-properties header, ENC/empty-H encoding, documented
fallback fields and history-checked preparation count 2. Original account keys,
attempt, country/locale and registration IDs were retained. The 1126-byte POST
returned HTTP 200 / fail / too_many_all_methods (329 bytes, 1017 ms), with
32417 seconds for retry, SMS and voice. The service persisted a cooldown;
no further request or delivery-method switch followed. No SMS dispatch or
successful registration was established for this number.
